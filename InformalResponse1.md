Data researcher, Joshua Blumenstock, sees tremendous potential for well-developed machine-learning algorithms and new approaches to solve humanitarian problems in international development.  However, he acknowledges the risks associated with applying technological solutions to unique contexts in developing countries without specific concentration on a particular location. The core technology Blumenstock describes was designed for “first-world purpose”, thereby the solutions by big data tend to exclude the most vulnerable citizens of society. For example, Blumenstock cites Google Maps and Waze as two primary data maps which are being used to assess urban mobility. Because these apps require individuals to own smartphones, the extracted information that will be used in policy decision making will primarily benefit the wealthiest people of society while simultaneously excluding major segments of the population in developing countries who don’t have access to smartphones. Arguably the two most concerning pitfalls Blumenstock notes are the risk of misappropriation and the lack of attention to individuals in need when applying these tools. As mentioned in the article, mobile phone data is increasingly used for assessing credit scores and instantly distributing loans to citizens in many developing countries, yet a study from Kenya in 2015 revealed that only 51% of borrowers were informed or aware of the interest rate they were being charged with. Technology has incredible potential to transform international development. For example, satellite images may enable governments to distribute aid in a more efficient and helpful manner. However, it also holds to capacity to harm citizens in developing countries. With the example of digital credit and loans, for instance, there remains little insight as to whether digital loans are helping citizens or trapping them in poverty cycles as many short-term high-interest pay day loans do. One of the greatest challenges with developing new algorithms and applications is assessing their long-term accuracy and deciphering how one application may work in one setting but fail in another setting. 
Blumenstock would agree with the first classmate’s statement that "good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences". Data science as a discipline has the capacity to alleviate significant issues in developing countries, and because technological literacy is an increasingly valuable skill that many citizens in developing countries lack proficiency in, data scientists have the fundamental responsibility to deepen collaboration in order to tackle global development challenges. For ways forward, Blumenstock suggests that there is a strong need for solutions to be designed and produced by people who understand the problems and the given context and not just by those who understand the algorithms. As mentioned in the second student’s statement, Blumenstock touches on the need for an increase in algorithmic transparency, fairness, and accountability when it comes to issues of data privacy which currently remain in the hands of companies operating in developing countries. Many developing nations currently have few regulations that lack adequate enforcement. For the application of technology to become beneficial for vulnerable citizens, we need more transparency. Lastly, the balancing act considering the intersection of human development with data science referenced in the third student’s statement is the central issue that Blumenstock concerns his audience with. While we need to pay more attention to the development of the applications themselves, we also need to incorporate a stronger focus human centered morality as it pertains to global issues. Private sectors hold all the cards, yet with deeper collaboration with organizations and other programs, the advancements in data science can be revolutionary in global development.
