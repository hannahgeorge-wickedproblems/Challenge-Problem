# The total population of Malta's adm2 subdivisons, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha, is 26,278 persons, and there are 6 distinctly defined human settlements within the two divisions. As indicated by the plot, the most densely populated areas between these combined divisons are in the north-west (North Harbour bay) and in the south-central region. Notably, the population density is relatively low in areas where there is greater access to health care (black crosses indicate health care facilities: dentists, pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics). The network of roadways throughout Malta are mostly evenly distributed, offering easy access to transportation to health care facilities from more densely populated regions.
