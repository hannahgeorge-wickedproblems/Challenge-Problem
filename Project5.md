The total population of two of Malta's subdivisons, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha, is 26,278 persons, and there are 9 distinctly defined human settlements within the two divisions. As indicated by the plot, the north-west and south-central regions have the highest population densities of the combined area. Notably, the population density is relatively low in areas where there is greater access to health care (black crosses indicate health care facilities: dentists, pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics). Consisting of primary, secondary, and tertiary roads, the network of roadways throughout Malta are, for the most part, evenly distributed, connecting urban settlements to areas with health care facilities. 

# Accessibility 3: Rendering topography

Producing a three-dimensional, topographic plot of the urban areas reveals that the development of urban areas centers around building health care and transportation facilities in flat regions located near mountain ranges. Specifically, roadways had to be constructed on the perimeters of the mountains, likely to minimize transportation time from urban areas to health care facilities. Rendering this three-dimensional plot furthers our interpretation of urban settlment in Malta, suggesting that the most densely populated areas are found in mid-elevation regions.
