	Data science as a discipline is a highly integrative, multifaceted field that deepens our engagement with human development and advances our understanding of complex, adaptive economic and social systems. Placing the strongest emphasis on the data itself, data scientists differentiate themselves from other types of researchers through their human centric lens and by considering the measurements and local contexts themselves before applying models and statistics. The ideas from Aral, Roegen, and West reveal that data precedes science, it serves as a backbone for evolutionary systems and connectivity.

  Data scientists have the important role of taking data and creating novel, readable, and insightful data visualizations from raw numbers themselves. As Aral describes in his quote, science begins with measurements: without data, what can we do? The advent of data science works to honor these measurements and work with them to help promote our own understanding of complex adaptive systems and human development.

The second quote reflects on Roegen’s idea that economic systems are evolutionary systems in and of themselves. As we have learned through other readings this semester, static economic models that lack the comprehension and complexity of this adaptive system fail to capture an accurate depiction and predictions of the economy, and this holds true for social systems as well. Without the consideration that these systems are continuously coevolving, our analysis and predictions of critical human development processes will not benefit humans. Importantly, data science works to mitigate this flaw by considering the dynamics of social and economic systems alongside other coevolutionary forces.

Finally, Geoff West articulates that scales as an important component in the advent of data science and drives the predictive nature of the systems with understanding their evolutionary patterns. Data science considers the limitations and the benefits of the data itself and integrates ideas from all different disciplines in order for us to be able to do the things that West describes such as the ability to “construct, test, and refine our theories and models whether they seek to explain the origins of the universe, the nature of evolutionary processes, or the growth of the economy.”
