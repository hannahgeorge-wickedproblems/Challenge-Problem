Kitchen explains that traditional data analysis methods used to generate, process, analyze, and store massive collections of datasets limit our potential to understand the world. Because these traditional techniques adhere to strict assumptions and their production is tightly controlled, they are limited in scope, scale, and temporality. Furthermore, they were designed to produce a solution to a specific problem and were built around the scientific method: hypothesize, model, test approach. However, the advent of big data has shifted the way we think about research and it offers us an entirely new way of understanding the world. Rather than working around a testable hypothesis, expert systems now have the ability to apply numerous algorithms to datasets that can detect patterns and build predictive models to optimize outcomes. Petabytes enable us to analyze datasets without hypotheses, models, and theories. One notable line from Kitchen’s article that resonated with me reads: “We can throw the numbers into the biggest computing clusters…and let statistical algorithms find patterns where science cannot …science can advance even without coherent models, unified theories, or really any mechanistic explanation at all. There’s no reason to cling to our old ways.” (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951714528481)

Chris Anderson’s “End of Theory” article explains that the new availability of massive data and statistical tools has proven that machine learning algorithms can find patterns where traditional scientific methods cannot. Data science, as an interdisciplinary field of study, is moving away from knowledge-driven science and towards data-driven science, says Kitchen. One fascinating possibility that may serve to elevate data science as a discipline is the notion that the data speak for themselves and are free of human bias. Human bias is inherently embedded within most disciplines and has been a fundamental issue in the field of science in particular, but the potential for researchers to solve problems without human bias elevates data science as a discipline. 
Kitchen notes how big data can produce high resolution models of complex, human life, reshaping how social science research is conducted. Big data can shift our framing to provide an exhaustive, more holistic understanding of the human condition through digital collections of data. While many fear that organization of human societies are far too complex to be described by machines and models, others are optimistic that new approaches in data science enables social science researchers to obtain valuable, context-specific insights from big data.
