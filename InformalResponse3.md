Question #1. How does Owen Barder define development? 

Barder defines development as a property of the economic, social and political system as a whole rather than a series of individual successes. Comparing this complex adaptive system to a biological analogy, Barder illustrates that the complex adaptive system is constantly evolving, and development is the emergent property. The goal of development is to increase output in such a way that is consistent with the social values and goals of a given society. 


How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?

Amartya Sen’s vision of development excludes the reality that development is not, in fact, the sum of improvements in the general quality of peoples’ life or the outputs of firms. Barder takes this definition of development, indicates that we would like to envision development this way, but suggests that development should be thought of as a characteristic of the complex adaptive system instead. Barder contends that Sen’s definition of development is precisely that which economists have based their economic development models off of for the last five or so decades, and the problem, Barder reveals, is that this definition lacks multidimensional complexity that encompasses the true nature of the nonlinear, evolving system. Barder reshapes this idea of development as being a linear, stagnant process and suggests that we ought to think of the economy and society as being composed of a larger set of complex interactions between many adaptive, coevolving agents. 

What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?
 
The toaster project was a small scale, home-designed project, taken on by a British design student, Thomass Thwaites. He attempted to make an electric toaster oven from raw material, sourcing the cheapest parts he could find, yet the tribulations and difficulties he encountered during this project surprised him. Once finished with the toaster oven, Thwaites describes it as a partial success, as the toaster imploded seconds after he tried to plug it in. The message of the story, however, is that even developing a small scale cheap toaster requires a vast array of different parts and technologies. Applying this to business models, we can understand that the economy has to be rich to supply all of these materials and parts to make something. 
 
 
 
Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?

Barder demonstrates the lack of dimensionality and complexity in the conventional economic models that have been used to describe development and predict growth over the past 5 decades. For a long time, economists considered economic growth and economic development as being more or less the same. Under the false idea that development and growth is the sum of what happens to individuals and firms in the economy, economists have constructed models to fit this idea when in fact this draws no resemblance to reality. Barder points to the failure of the Washington Consensus to evidence the failures of economic models over the past 50 years. One of the traditional models, the Harrod-Domar Growth Model, tells us that in order to produce one unit of output, you combine a certain amount of labor with a certain amount of capital. 


Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at unilever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?

Steve Jones was an employee working for a company, Unilever, that produced laundry products. The company thought the failure laid in their manufacturing plans, but it was Jones who discovered that the nozzle didn’t work properly and was the source of failure. He helped design new nozzles that would hopefully fix this issue, and after many many trials and tribulations, they had a working nozzle. His results were significant, not because of the outcome, but because of the attention Jones paid to the planning and designing process, a skill that economists and those involved in development need to adapt. 

What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?

A complex adaptive system involves a large number of adaptive processes coevolving. Its important features are not predictable in advance but emergent, drawing the need for continuous adaptation to be compatible with the changing environment. Barder outlines five important features of complex adaptive systems. The first feature is the butterfly effect, which tells us that in a nonlinear system, a small change that occurs in one part of the system can trigger a chain of events in a separate space. Another feature is that complex systems reveal patterns of self-organized global order.


Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?

Haile Sellasie was a leader of Ethiopia after World War II who sought to launch Ethiopia into progressive development. During the time of the emperor, Ethiopia tried to manufacture a product that was abundant, but they never produced any of it. This failure came as a result of the fact that economic models did not account for the context but worked to fit a larger, broader scale. Furthermore, the dynamics in Ethiopia made it such that the country hasn’t experienced a rapid change to a more complex, self-organized system because they preserve the power in the hands of the elites. 

Why did Barder recommend resisting engineering asd a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?



Barder suggests that it is nearly impossible to engineer solutions in a complex adaptive system because each specific  improvement has to change in the context of its environment, and because it is impossible to predict the result of any single change. Furthermore, Barder points out that the problem with it is that developing countries tend to adopt “international best practice”, without adapting the policies to the context of their local environment. Iso-morphic mimicry can best be explained by the idea that institutions can take on the image of being a capable organization despite not having any of the associated, functioning parts for performance. This term describes how an institution can look good without functioning properly. 

What does Barder mean by “resist fatalism”? Who was Normal Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

Barder’s second policy conclusion from his analysis is to resist fatalism. We don’t have to accept the outcome of the changes because we have the capability to improve innovation and actively choose the functioning microprocesses that are giving us the best possible outcome.  Norman Borlaug was an economist who introduced the fundamental aspect of technical change in developing countries particularly working in the development of food production, and this movement was termed the Green Revolution.
