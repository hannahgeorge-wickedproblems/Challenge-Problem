  Geoff West declares that the goal of his book is to explore both the nature and the origin of interconnected systematic scaling laws from multiple perspectives in order to promote our understanding of human development and complex adaptive systems. He opens his first chapter with several graphical visualizations that illustrate how scaling relationships quantitatively describe how any measurable characteristic changes with size, and these scaling curves reveal the rudimentary, systematic, and predictable truths about human centered data. Importantly, these predictable patterns reveal that there is a shared conceptual framework which underlies the phenomena that the dynamics, innovations, and organizations of all living systems which are subject to universal scaling laws. Three examples of how scales can be used to fully understand global issues in development are the big picture framework, analyzing implications of rapid growth, and the fitness of systems. 
  
  The first example of how we use scales to understand human development is the notion that the big picture conceptual framework operates with scales and is utilized to address questions from multiple perspectives. Scaling refers to how a system responds when size changes, and considering questions about how and why systems change with scale has tremendous outcomes that can deepen our understanding of important systematic dynamics. A central thread that serves as a network between companies, cities, and social behavior is the shared systematic regularities in their organization, structure, and dynamics, and this commonality allows for a transdisciplinary approach to solving key issues facing human development. Notably, the most important shared feature is that they are all highly complex, adaptive, and composed of enormous units evolving over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Addressing broad questions and proposing a variety of solutions allows West to integrate fundamental questions from the perspective of a biologist, a physicist, and an economist simultaneously. Evidently, the integration of multiple disciplines allows for an enriched understanding of some of the key issues of human development. 
  
  Within the context of human development, rapid urbanization, industrialization, and socioeconomic development is indisputably changing the future of our planet, its inhabitants, and its systems. Scales drive the predictive science of companies. Similar to how exponents and scaling laws work for organisms, companies tend to grow rapidly before reaching maturity then slow in growth and eventually stop growing relative to the GDP.  Scaling determines the success or the failure of a company, a city, or any system, and scales allow us to adapt as cities and social behavior evolves through human interaction. West warns his audience of the implications, that is, both the global challenges and advantages associated with accelerated development. It is important to consider the origin of scales in terms of a system’s lifespan, whether that is an individual’s life span or a company’s life span, in order to understand the mechanisms behind how each of these systems either survives or dies. As humans became more complex through the introduction of social behavior, so did our needs. While rapid urbanization promotes necessary innovation, it also systematically increases negative indicators such as a faster spread of disease. Ultimately, scaling allows for us to understand what is required to sustain each system.

The third example deals with the consideration of how to promote the influx of energy required for growth and innovation. Maintaining order and structure in complex and adapting systems requires a continual input of energy, and supplying more energy for growth is how we combat entropy production, which will inevitably lead to the degradation of the system. However, after a system reaches its peak maturity, that is the period between its accelerated growth and its maturity point, the issue becomes increasingly difficult to supply energy for innovation and repair. Thereby, West proposes that scaling laws can be used to predict how a company or a system will age, and scales could allow innovators to overcome this issue through model predictions. 

In light of the use of theory and big data, West connects this back to his argument that we need a cohesive theory to quantitatively recognize the world through the big picture framework. One theory that West includes to exemplify this notion of connectedness is the theory of the six degrees of separation articulated by Stanley Milgram. This theory grew out of the question of how many people, on average, separate one individual from any other arbitrary individual in the world. He graphically represented his theory by drawing a line between dots, resembling humans, where the link between the dots illustrates the proportion of small-world networks with lots of clustering relative to the randomly connected networks. Dunan Watts attempted to verify Milgram’s theory by modeling big data on email messages sent between individuals to determine the number of links required to connect two arbitrary individuals. These examples show how social networks between systems can be modeled and provide useful, implicit information about global issues in human development and complex adaptive systems.
