# Project 3 ~ Acquiring, Modifying, and Describing the Data: Malta

# Extracting Land Use and Land Cover Data for Description
#### The histogram represents the logarithm of the population density for each of the second level subdivisions of Malta

#### The histogram represents the population density of Malta compared to the slope of the land. As expected, the population density is smallest when the slope is steepest.

# Modeling the Relationships between Population Density and Two Variables with Estimated Linear Regression Models 
#### The linear regression model shows the relationship between Malta's population density (pop20) and the night time lights (ntl).

#### As seen in the summary, the calculated R^2 value is approximately 0.391

#### The linear regression model demonstrates the relationship between Malta's population density and water.
